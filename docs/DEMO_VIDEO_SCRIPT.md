# SecureFlow — 3-Minute Demo Video Script

**Total length: ~3 minutes**  
Use this as a voiceover or talking-point script while you screen-record the app. Pause or speed up slightly to hit 3 minutes.

---

## 0:00 – 0:25 — Hook + problem (25 sec)

**[Screen: SecureFlow dashboard, or a simple slide with the tagline.]**

> “Most fraud detection today happens **after** the transaction is already done. By then, the money has moved and the damage is done.
>
> We built **SecureFlow** to show that it doesn’t have to be that way. You can score every transaction for fraud **in real time** — in under 100 milliseconds — **before** you approve it. And you can explain every decision in plain English.
>
> Here’s how it works.”

---

## 0:25 – 0:45 — What you’re looking at (20 sec)

**[Screen: Dashboard — header, controls, empty or slow stream.]**

> “This is the SecureFlow dashboard. On the left we have a **live stream** of transactions. Each row is one transaction we send to our API. We’ll see the amount, the merchant, a **risk score** from zero to 100, how long the decision took, and whether it was **approved** or **flagged**.
>
> Up here we have a **latency meter** — we’re aiming for under 100 milliseconds — and a **risk gauge** for the latest score. There’s also a **Demo mode** checkbox so we get more flagged transactions for the demo.
>
> Let me turn on Demo mode and start the stream.”

**[Action: Check Demo mode. Click Start stream.]**

---

## 0:45 – 1:30 — Live stream + first flag (45 sec)

**[Screen: Stream running, rows appearing with scores and OK/Flagged.]**

> “Transactions are now flowing. Each one is sent to our backend, scored in real time, and the result comes back in milliseconds. You can see the latency here — we’re staying under 100 milliseconds.
>
> Notice some rows show **Flagged** in red. Those are transactions that crossed our risk threshold. The system didn’t just block them in a black box — it **scored** them and **explained** why.
>
> Let me click one of these flagged transactions.”

**[Action: Click a row that shows “Flagged”.]**

---

## 1:30 – 2:15 — Side panel + explainability (45 sec)

**[Screen: Side panel open — explanation, signals, recommendation.]**

> “This side panel is the heart of **explainability**. For this flagged transaction we show: the **risk score**, a **recommendation** — like Hold or Verify — and most importantly, a **plain-English explanation** of why it was flagged. We also list each **fraud signal** that contributed: things like ‘amount way above the user’s normal,’ or ‘transaction from a country they’ve never used before.’
>
> That explanation can be generated by an AI — we use Groq — or by simple templates. Either way, every flagged decision is **auditable**: we log transaction ID, score, signals, and timestamp so compliance and operations can see exactly what happened.
>
> So we’re not just fast — we’re **transparent**.”

**[Action: Optionally scroll the signals list or point at the recommendation.]**

## 2:15 – 2:45 — IBM Telum + wrap (30 sec)

**[Screen: Back to stream, or a simple slide with “Inspired by IBM Telum”.]**

> “SecureFlow is inspired by **IBM’s Telum processor** in the IBM z16 mainframe. Telum does AI inference **on-chip** during transaction execution — no extra round-trips, no extra latency. We’re simulating that idea in software: our API scores every transaction in the same request path, before approval.
>
> So in about three minutes you’ve seen: **real-time** fraud scoring, **sub-100-millisecond** decisions, **explainable** flags with clear recommendations, and a design that mirrors putting AI right in the transaction path — the way Telum does it on the mainframe.
>
> That’s **SecureFlow**. Thanks for watching.”

## Tips for recording

1. **Before you record:** Backend and frontend running; Demo mode ready; one tab on the dashboard.
2. **If no flag appears:** Keep Demo mode on; you can say “We’re in demo mode so we see flags regularly” and click the next one that appears.
3. **Keep the latency meter visible** when you talk about speed so judges see &lt;100 ms.
4. **Speak clearly and slightly slower** than normal; 3 minutes is enough to cover everything without rushing.
5. **Optional:** Add short captions or a title card at the start: “SecureFlow — 3-Minute Demo.”
